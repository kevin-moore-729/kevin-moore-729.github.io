        48 hours ago, I was in the Dublin Airport. I had never heard of Gulp or Bootstrap or Node.
        I hadn’t eaten an Oreo in years. It’s amazing how things can change in just two days time.
        This summer I am participating in a Web Developer Bootcamp, dedicating to preparing people from various career
        paths for a new career in web and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        2 years ago, I was preparing for graduate school. I had just completed my bachelor’s degree and was headed to a
        good school on scholarship. I had never heard of Command Line or HTML or CSS. I only drank one cup of coffee every day.
        It’s amazing how things can change in 2 years time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never envisioned myself having any interest in programming as a career. I had always been a humanities kid.
        However, 2 years ago, I realized that the career path I had prepared for myself was one I was defaulting into.
        I was continuing to do what I had always done rather than considering if it was actually something I wanted to do.
        When I took the time to reflect on my goals in life, and the kind of career that I would need to meet them,
        web development became an incredibly attractive option.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though I had found a new career candidate, I dismissed it as impossible. I had no experience, nor the time for
        3+ years of school to get a CS degree. At the encouragement of a friend who had completed the program,
        I looked up the Web Development Bootcamp at Awesome Inc. It promised to deliver everything I was looking for,
        and I was completely sold. When Awesome Inc offered me a spot in their summer bootcamp, I readily accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like I said, I was in a different country only 48 hours ago. My travel plans forced me to miss the first week and a
        half of the class. When the entire program is only 12 weeks, that’s a pretty substantial absence.
        Therefore, my first display was a crash course of a crash course. I don’t know if I ever had to take notes in my
        college career as fast as I had to take them here. In one day we must have covered what would take a month in a
        traditional classroom setting. We considered the power of CSS selectors, the convenience of tooling packages like
        Bootstrap and Sass, and the programming complexity of a simple calculator. In that time, I also had at least 4 Oreos.
        At least. After 8 hours of intensive study, I went home and tried to review more of what I had missed.
        I could feel the fatigue setting in, but every small breakthrough or connection I made pushed me forward.
        When I finally went to sleep, I was excited to do it again the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this to say, the content of this blog will be from the perspective of someone who is experiencing programming
        for the first time. I never expected to be here. This program, and the career that hopefully follows it, were never
        in my mind a few short years ago. But, after just 1 day, I am certainly thankful for how things can change in a short time.
