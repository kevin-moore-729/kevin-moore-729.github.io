    <h1>Insecure Content</h1>

        I had just deployed my first web application to Heroku. I had been a full time web development student for 4 days.
        It was a pretty simple website, a mock restaurant with a homepage and navbar taking you to a couple other basic pages.
        One of the project requirements was a menu delivered by an API request, which I included as a button that executes the
        Javascript function to call the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        My app was live on Heroku (which was no small feat, considering I hadn’t used Express or Node, let alone Heroku until the
        day before) and all that was left was to test the functionality before I could tweak the design. First I tested the navbar,
        and to my excitement, it worked as intended. The images all loaded correctly. All that was left was the menu feature.
        I hit the button, and nothing happened on my page. I was disappointed. I noticed a small shield icon appear in my URL bar.
        I clicked it and it revealed its meaning:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Insecure Content. Do you wish to continue?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment it was as if this little icon was describing me specifically. Insecure content.
        That pretty much summed up the bootcamp experience for me thus far. The true nature of this warning is much easier to
        explain than its metaphorical value. Once I inspected the console of the menu page, I discovered the technical issue.
        I was trying to deliver mixed content. Specifically, I was delivering HTTP content to a Heroku page, which is natively
        served as HTTPS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standard HTTP refers to ‘Hypertext Transfer Protocol’, and basically describes how data is transmitted to users on the
        internet. HTTPS simply adds ‘Secure’ to the end of the acronym. It encrypts the transaction of information between
        user and websites. It is not a profoundly complicated distinction, but one that I never would have noticed before
        this bootcamp. Naturally, pages loaded over HTTPS don’t appreciate elements introduced over just HTTP. The HTTP element
        creates the opportunity for dangerous or otherwise unexpected action to be taken by a third party during the exchange
        between user and website. The level of threat in this situation is determined by the level of activity assigned to the
        mixed content by the developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mixed Content can either be considered Passive or Active.
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content#mixed_content_types_security_threats_associated" target="_blank">
        This blog</a> provides a more detailed distinction between the two.
        Essentially, passive content is isolated to its individual place, and could be an image or video among other things.
        It appears on the page, but doesn’t interact with its operation. Active content, on the other hand, includes scripts and
        stylesheets and therefore could give access to the inner workings of the page. Naturally, Active mixed content is more
        dangerous to the user than Passive, but ideally neither would be delivered on an HTTPS server. Normally, this would be
        just another part of the Web Developer education: Don’t deliver insecure content on a secure server.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this lesson tapped into something a little deeper for me: insecurity in general. I’ve always struggled with
        insecurity, a burden that is exponentially heavier when trying something new. And this bootcamp is very, very new to me.
        I have spent most of my life seeking comfort rather than new experiences. I was good at some things, and assumed I was
        bad at others, so I just did the things I thought I was good at. I touched on this in my previous post so I won’t repeat
        it again here.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, 7 days into this process I am getting more accustomed to insecurity. It defines my experience almost every time
        I open my text editor or terminal. Something will go wrong, I’ll get pushed outside of my comfort zone, and I’l have to
        figure it out. It’s a pattern I’ve repeated countless times over the past week and a half, and it’s starting to be one I
        almost enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entry has gone on long enough so I’ll wrap up in saying: if you’ve somehow found this blog and you are staring
        down the long road of becoming a professional programmer with little prior experience, get used to insecurity.
        You’re going to experience a lot of it. In your life, it’s better to embrace it than avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on your webpages, you should probably try to keep things secure.
