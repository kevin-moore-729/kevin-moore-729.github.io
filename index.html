    <p>
      I'm a guy in Lexington, KY trying to go from zero to web development hero in 12 weeks!
      This page is intended to show you a little of who I am and what I can do. I'll also occasionally
      post blog entries here discussing programming, but other topics may include donuts, hip hop, the NBA, and video games.
    </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <img class="profileImage" src="app/images/IMG_1310.jpg">

    <div class="mainText">
      <p>
        <span></span>I usually don't indulge in self description, so bear with me here for a little. I am a Junior Web Developer in training,
        but that is only the latest in a long line of hats I've worn in my short 24 years. I've been a specialty donut engineer
        (that's a real title don't question it), a coffeeshop manager, a graphic designer, a summer camp director, a minor league
        baseball cheerleader and a mobile bartender. And those are just the jobs I've been paid for. If you're interested, you
        can grab a copy of my resume <a href="app/subpages/WebDevResumeFinal.pdf" download>here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span></span>I am a native of Lexington, KY where I graduated from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School and eventually Transylvania University
        with a degree in Religious Studies. Naturally, the next step was to spend 2 years trying to figure out what I wanted to do with
        my life. Out of a desire for sustainable professional relevency and an inherent interest in the way people interact with
        technology, I settled on Web Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span></span>I intended to enroll in a computer science program at a large university, but on the recommendation of a friend, I looked
        into Awesome Inc's Web Developer Bootcamp. The premise of the program was ambitious, to take the programming illiterate and
        turn them into job ready, full stack Web Developers in just 12 weeks. Compared to the (at least) 3 years it would take to earn a degree
        in Computer Science, the promise of a 12 week program was too good to pass up. So, here I am! You can find examples
        of my work from the bootcamp under the Portfolio tab, and the blog tab contains responses to bootcamp prompts as well as
        other ramblings of my own. Thanks for stopping by!
